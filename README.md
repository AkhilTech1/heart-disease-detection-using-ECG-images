Project Title: Advanced Cardiac ECG Analysis System

Description:
Developed a hybrid ECG analysis platform that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), MobileNetV2, and Naive Bayes models for accurate detection of cardiac conditions from ECG images. The system allows users to upload ECG images, automatically processes the signals, extracts key cardiac features, and provides detailed visualizations along with a comprehensive diagnostic report.

Key Features:

Cardiac Pattern Recognition: Detects subtle irregularities in ECG signals using deep learning.

Hybrid Classification: Combines deep learning feature extraction with probabilistic Naive Bayes analysis for enhanced accuracy.

Performance Metrics: Reports model metrics including Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, and AUC.

Visualization: Generates clear ECG feature visualizations and a confusion matrix for better interpretability.

Conditions Detected: Normal heart rhythm, Abnormal Heartbeat (Arrhythmias), Myocardial Infarction (MI), and History of MI.

User Interface: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fully integrated with Python backend for seamless user interaction.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Python, Jupyter Notebook / IPython Widgets

Machine Learning Models: CNN, MobileNetV2, Naive Bayes

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Visualization: Base64 encoded images, dynamic HTML rendering

Outcome:
The system achieves >99% accuracy in detecting cardiac anomalies, providing a reliable tool for preliminary ECG evaluation and aiding medical professionals in diagnosis.
